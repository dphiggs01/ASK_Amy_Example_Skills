      ~~~
    * Note: Subsequent deploys should use (deploy).
        ~~~
        $ ask-amy-cli deploy_lambda --deploy-json-file cli_config.json
        ~~~
    * Take note of the "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:**********2273:function:alexa_*****"

3. Create a new skill in your Amazon Development Account.

Many of the example skills were first published as Java or Node.js code
by Amazon https://github.com/amzn. However since Amazon created the _new_
interaction model the original code is no longer available.
